              <p>We believe theatre should get to the core of what it is to be human. Despite our differences we all share our humanity and we believe good theatre discovers our similarities and celebrates our differences.</p>

              <p>We believe theatre should reach as many people as possible. Every year Wanderweg will tour at least one production, being sure to reach underrepresented areas, working to broaden the impact powerful theatre can have. We encourage mutual conversation and sharing. Accompanying our productions are opportunities to discuss, interact, and engage: we hold regular talk-backs and workshops, as well spontaneous conversations over coffee or a beer. We are people first artists second.</p>

              <p>We will never create “high” art. Pretension is the enemy of accessibility. As we work to create productions that are accessible to a wide range of audiences, we will continue to push boundaries and refuse to settle for the safe choice. Whether it’s a comedy, drama, or somewhere in between, we will present truthful work, honoring the incredibly broad spectrum of the human condition.</p>

              <p>Wanderweg exists for its audience. The plays are meant to be seen, discussed, debated (seen again!), and ultimately carried with the audience as they leave the theatre.</p>

              <p>In Northern Ireland, two communities are at odds with each other. Their conflict is not only political, but ideological. The Protestant Loyalist side believes that Northern Ireland should remain part of the United Kingdom. The Catholic Nationalist side believes that Northern Ireland should become part of the Republic of Ireland. “The Troubles” refer to the thirty years of violence and terrorism between these two groups. Peace resolutions in the late 1990s brought an end to the sectarian violence, but the peace achieved is a shaky one.</p>

<p>The Celtic Cross is the story of the unlikely friendship that forms between Jacob and Thomas, two young men in Belfast, Northern Ireland; Jacob is a Protestant Loyalist and Thomas is a Catholic Nationalist. Set in the early 1990s, before the peace agreement, these two men have lived their entire life during “the Troubles.” Although they are conditioned to hate each other, an improbable friendship unfolds, but their circumstances force them to choose between their friendship and their beliefs.</p>

<p>This powerful new drama explores what it means to be Protestant, Catholic, Irish, British, too powerful for your own good, but too weak to change anything.  But at its deepest – at its core – the play shows these two characters in their struggle to find humanity; in their friend, in their enemy, but most importantly – in themselves.</p>
