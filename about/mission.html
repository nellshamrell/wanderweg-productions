              <p>We believe theatre should get to the core of what it is to be human. Despite our differences we all share our humanity and we believe good theatre discovers our similarities and celebrates our differences.</p>

              <p>We believe theatre should reach as many people as possible. Every year Wanderweg will tour at least one production, being sure to reach underrepresented areas, working to broaden the impact powerful theatre can have. We encourage mutual conversation and sharing. Accompanying our productions are opportunities to discuss, interact, and engage: we hold regular talk-backs and workshops, as well spontaneous conversations over coffee or a beer. We are people first artists second.</p>

              <p>We will never create “high” art. Pretension is the enemy of accessibility. As we work to create productions that are accessible to a wide range of audiences, we will continue to push boundaries and refuse to settle for the safe choice. Whether it’s a comedy, drama, or somewhere in between, we will present truthful work, honoring the incredibly broad spectrum of the human condition.</p>

              <p>Wanderweg exists for its audience. The plays are meant to be seen, discussed, debated (seen again!), and ultimately carried with the audience as they leave the theatre.</p>
